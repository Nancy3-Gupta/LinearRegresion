# LinearRegression
It is a machine learning model whose equation is of the form y=mx+c
Here the regression coefficient tells how each factor affects the output .Higher the regression coefficient higher is the impact of that corresponding factor on the result. In my project I have taken some random values of hours of study and exam score. But these factors are directly proportional.Hence Linear Regression can be applied
